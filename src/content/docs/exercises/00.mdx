## Prerequisites

Before we get started with the exercises, be sure to clone the demo repo and install dependencies.

<Steps>
1. Visit the public [demo repo](https://github.com/Bixal/drupal-govcon-2025-demo) and clone it:

    ```sh
    git@github.com:Bixal/drupal-govcon-2025-demo.git
    ```

1. Go into the demo folder.

    ```sh
    cd ./drupal-govcon-2025-demo
    ```

1. Install dependencies.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. To test everything is working, run the component library.

    ```sh
    npm run lib
    ```

1. Alternatively, you can also run the docs site project.

    ```sh
    npm run docs
    ```

</Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

That's it ðŸŽ‰! You've now installed all dependencies for both projects and are ready to get started.
