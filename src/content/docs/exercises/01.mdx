You can follow along in the [demo](https://github.com/Bixal/drupal-govcon-2025-demo) repository.

In this exercise we'll see the importance of using [USWDS component packages](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/packages/).

## The Default Approach

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Steps>
1. If you're new to USWDS you've probably seen the styles being loaded like so:

    ```scss
    // your-styles-entrypoint.scss

    // The entire USWDS styles.
    @forward "uswds";

    // Your custom project styles.
    @forward "your-project-styles";
    ```

1. You can see this in action in the demo repo:


    ```scss
    // ./storybook/packages/index.scss

    @forward "uswds";
    ```

1. In your terminal, run the component library.

    ```sh
    # drupal-govcon-2025-demo ➜
    npm run lib
    ```

1. Visit the documentation page.

    ```sh
    http://localhost:6060/?path=/story/pages-landing--default
    ```

    You should see the standard USWDS documentation page all styled and looking mostly good.

1. Next, go back to your terminal and stop the task or open a new tab and compile the styles.

    ```sh
    # drupal-govcon-2025-demo ➜
    npm run build:vite -w storybook
    ```

1. After around 4 seconds you'll get a compiled CSS file you can see in `./storybook/dist`

    <FileTree>
    - storybook/
        - dist/
            - assets/
                - index-[a_random_hash].css # 565KB
    </FileTree>

    If you open up finder and you'll see that the file weighs about `565KB`. Using the entire stylesheet without thinking about the components you'll use, like in the previous exercise, can be a heavy handed approach.

    Let's take a leaner approach by using USWDS component packages.

## Replacing with Packages

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Steps>

1. Make sure your local component library environment is running.

    ```sh
    # drupal-govcon-2025-demo ➜
    npm run lib
    ```

1. Open up the `index.scss` file.

    ```scss
    // ./storybook/index.scss
    @forward "uswds-theme";

    @forward "uswds";
    ```

1. Remove the `@forward`.

    ```diff
    // ./storybook/index.scss

    @forward "uswds-theme";

    - @forward "uswds";
    ```

1. Next, open the documentation page in your browser. You should see an unstyled page.

    ```sh
    http://localhost:6060/?path=/story/pages-landing--default
    ```

1. First, let's identify the components we have on the page.

1. Next we'll use the table in the [USWDS Packages docs](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/packages/) and import what we need. Let's fix the Government Banner first.

    ```diff
    // ./storybook/index.scss

    + @forward "usa-banner";
    ```

    You should see a much quicker compile in your terminal. The page should auto refresh and you should see a banner with some styles.

    Can you add the remaining packages?

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>

      Your index file should look like this:

      ```scss
      // ./storybook/index.scss

      @forward "usa-accordion";
      @forward "usa-banner";
      @forward "usa-button";
      @forward "usa-skipnav";
      @forward "usa-header";
      @forward "usa-hero";
      @forward "usa-section";
      @forward "usa-footer";
      @forward "usa-identifier";
      ```
    </details>

    You might have noticed that some packages already include other components. For example, `usa-button` styles appear with `usa-header` styles. If you also forward buttons you'll only load it once thanks to SASS modules.


1. We're just missing a few bundled packages to make this work, the global styles that includes the CSS normalize and the typography. In the packages table they're called `uswds-global` `uswds-typography`.

    ```scss
    @forward "uswds-global";
    @forward "uswds-typography";
    ```

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>

      Your index file should look like this:

      ```scss
      // ./storybook/index.scss

      @forward "usa-accordion";
      @forward "usa-banner";
      @forward "usa-button";
      @forward "usa-skipnav";
      @forward "usa-header";
      @forward "usa-hero";
      @forward "usa-section";
      @forward "usa-footer";
      @forward "usa-identifier";
      ```
    </details>

1. If you take a look at the page again, you should see the page is styled again.

1. Run the build command again and see that your styles are much leaner too.

    ```sh
    npm run build:vite -w storybook
    ```

    The `index.css` file should be `149KB` now, saving _416KB_ from our original. Not only do you get faster builds and leaner styles, but now you're setup to be able to extend!
