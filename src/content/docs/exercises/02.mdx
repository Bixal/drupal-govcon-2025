import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import WireframeImage from "../../../assets/wireframe.svg";

Let's apply what we've learned about design language. Your given the task to migrate an existing page to USWDS components.

Using design system language, how would you communicate:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Steps>
1. What are the major components of the page?

1. What are the smaller components?

1. What colors will be used in the design?

1. What fonts will be used in the design?

1. What spacing will be used in the design?
</Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

<img
  src={WireframeImage.src}
  alt="Homepage wireframe: header, hero, 3 columns news and events, a tile grid,  and footer"
/>
