If you're not ready to touch code you can use the principles or guidance to improve your work.

## 21c IDEA Act & Compliance

The 21st Century IDEA act mandates teams to create a digital-first experiences for the public that are accessible, user-centered, plain language, and more. Meeting these requirements can be _a lot_ of work.

This is where using USWDS as a foundation gives you an advantage. Even before adding a single line of USWDS code, you can use the [design principles | USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/) to guide your approach to content, UX research, and design.

## USWDS Design Principles

If you follow these principles you'll be ready to contribute to USWDS, extend it, or branch out and create your own design system.

- **Start with real user needs.** Research and test your products with real users.
- **Earn trust.** Don't assume that users will trust you just because you're a government site. Work like you're gaining their trust for the first time, _every time_. Using plain language is crucial.
- **Embrace accessibility.** Build in accessibility everywhere, this includes code, presentations, guidance, slides, spreadsheets, etc etc.
- **Promote continuity.** Minimize disruptions, be consistent, and build for the big picture, instead of a single, one-off task. This becomes especially important as you start supporting multiple products.
- **Listen.** Always be open to feedback and learn how people use your product to improve it.

These are proven principles that you can adopt into your work. Even if you don't have a design system or plan to create one.

## Incremental Adoption

One of USWDS's greatest features is its flexibility. You don't have to adopt everything all at once. The USWDS maturity model is a clear path to incremental adoption.

Take advantage of this flexibility to get a head start. Integrate at your own pace and team abilities. Here are the 3 levels from the maturity model showing how you can get started:

<Steps>
1. **Principles**. Apply the design principles in your daily work.

2. **Guidance**. Follow the UX guidance for core elements, like buttons, forms, and patterns.

3. **Code**. You might not need to adopt everything all at once. Here are a few ways you can use USWDS code:
   - Use core code, icons, and fonts.
   - Use tokens in styles or use them to create new components.
   - Create a base theme using USWDS theme settings.
   - Replace custom components with USWDS components that are customizable, accessible, and meet compliance.

</Steps>
