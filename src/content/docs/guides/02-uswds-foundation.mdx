Focus on the things that really matter. The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) is an open-source design system that lets you do just that. It's flexible, customizable, and work is done in the open. It gives you everything you need to start branching out. Even if you're not ready to touch code you can use the principles or guidance to improve your work.

## 21c IDEA Act & Compliance

The 21st Century IDEA act mandates teams to create a digital-first experience for the public that are accessible, user-centered, plain language, and more. Meeting these requirements can be _a lot_ of work.

This is where using USWDS as a foundation gives you an advantage. Even before adding a single line of USWDS code, you can use the [design principles | USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/) to guide your approach to content, UX research, and design.

### USWDS Design Principles

- **Start with real user needs.** Research and test your products with real users.
- **Earn trust.** Don't assume that users will trust you just because you're a government site. Work like you're gaining their trust for the first time, _every time_. Using plain language is crucial.
- **Embrace accessibility.** Build in accessibility everywhere, this includes code, presentations, guidance, slides, spreadsheets, etc etc.
- **Promote continuity.** Minimize disruptions, be consistent, and build for the big picture, instead of a single, one-off task. This becomes especially important as you start supporting multiple products.
- **Listen.** Always be open to feedback and learn how people use your product to improve it.

If you follow these principles you'll be ready to jump in and contribute to USWDS, extend it, or branch out and create your own design system.

**<Icon name="approve-check" color="var(--sl-color-green)" class="inline-icon" /> After**

> If you are registered at your current address, you will receive a full ballot that includes all offices and issues for your location.

## Incremental Adoption

One of USWDS's greatest features is its flexibility. You don't have to adopt everything all at once. The USWDS maturity model is a clear path to incremental adoption, which lets you integrate at your own pace and team abilities.

Here are the 3 levels from the maturity model showing how you can get started:

<Steps>
1. **Principles**. Apply the principles in your daily work.

2. **Guidance**. Follow the UX guidance for core elements, like buttons, forms, and patterns.

3. **Code**. You might not need to adopt everything all at once. Here are a few ways you can use USWDS code:
   - Use core code and settings to create a base theme.
   - Apply tokens in styles or use them to create new components.
   - Replacing existing components with USWDS components.
