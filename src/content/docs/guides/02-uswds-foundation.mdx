The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) is an open-source design system that we can learn a lot from. It's flexible, customizable, and work is done in the open. It gives you everything you need to start branching out, even if you just need help with the stuff outside of code, like principles or guidance.

## 21c IDEA Act & Compliance

The 21st Century IDEA act mandates teams to create a digital-first experience for the public. These experiences must have certain requirements, like accessibility, user-centered products, plain language, and more.

Using USWDS as a foundation helps you meet the requirements. Even before adding a single line of USWDS code, you can use the [design principles | USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/) to guide your approach to content, UX research, and design.

### USWDS Design Principles

- **Start with real user needs.** Research and test your products with real users.
- **Earn trust.** Don't assume that users will trust you just because you're a government site. Approach your work as if you're gaining their trust for the first time. _Using plain language is crucial_.
- **Embrace accessibility.** Build in accessibility into every level of your work, including code, presentations, guidance, or other materials.
- **Promote continuity.** Minimize disruptions, be consistent, and build for the big picture, instead of a single, one-off task. This becomes especially important as you start supporting multiple products.
- **Listen.** Always be open to feedback and learn how people use your product to improve it.

If you follow these principles you'll be ready to jump in and contribute to USWDS or branch out and extend it.

## Incremental Adoption

The USWDS maturity model has 3 levels of adopting the design system.

<Steps>
1. **Principles**. Apply the principles in your daily work.

2. **Guidance**. Follow the UX guidance for core elements, like buttons, forms, and patterns.

3. **Code**. You might not need to adopt everything all at once. Here are a few ways you can use USWDS code:
   - Use core code and settings to create a base theme
   - Apply tokens in styles or use them to create new components
   - Replacing existing components with USWDS components

</Steps>
