title: Choosing Your Tech Stack
description: Considerations for deciding what tools to use for your design system.
---

Creating a design system comes with a lot of technical considerations. Choosing the right tools can make your design system easy to maintain and scale. Picking the wrong ones can make it challenging. Here are some key things to consider.

## General Considerations

- **Know Your Audience and Their Needs**: Figure out what problems you want your design system to solve. Ask yourself:
  - Are your apps inconsistent?
  - Do you need to improve performance?
  - Will you support different frameworks or platforms?
  - Does cost matter, including future maintenance or migration?
  - What would lower the barrier to adoption?

  Having a clearly defined problem will help you choose the right tools.

- **Start Small, Focus on Adoption, and Iterate**: Start with the core components and features. Focus on promoting and integrating the design system across your teams to build a foundation, and continuously gather feedback to improve the design system.

## Core Components

### Design Tools

Choose tools that fit your design team and work well with your development workflow.

- [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/): A popular choice for collaborative design, especially for creating shared design assets and components.
- [**Zeroheight**](https://zeroheight.com/): A static documentation site generator that integrates well with design systems for generating and hosting documentation.
- [**USWDS Design Tokens**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/): Manage color, typography, and other design tokens to ensure consistency across your design and code.

### Dev Tools

Pick tools your team knows and match your projects.

#### Component Libraries

Pre-built UI components that you can reuse.

- [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/): An open-source tool for building and maintaining React, Vue, Angular, or web components. It allows you to develop, test, document, and share components in an isolated environment.
- [**StencilJS**](https://stenciljs.com/): Create, test, and share UI components, with strong integrations with other tools and platforms.

#### Frameworks

- **HTML5**: Consider this web native method if you are looking for minimal dependencies and simplicity.
- **JS libraries**: Consider frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular that can enhance your design systemâ€™s functionality, interactivity, and maintainability.
- **Web Components**: Consider if web components provide a framework-agnostic solution for creating highly reusable and encapsulated custom elements.
  - [**Lit**](https://lit.dev/): Web components with minimal layer for improving the developer experience. Opposite of StencilJS, which comes with a component library, testing, and more. Important if you don't want too much all at once or want to be tied to specific tool.
  - [**Open Web Components**](https://open-wc.org/): A combination of small open source tools and libraries for developing web components.

#### Testing

Test often and thoroughly to maintain quality and reliability.

- **Unit Testing**: Check individual components using a tool like React Testing Library, Mocha, Vitest, or Jest.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Make sure everything works together using a tool such as Cypress.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Meet accessibility standards with tools like sA11y.
- **Visual Regression**: Check your design for visual changes and keep everything looking consistent with tools like Chromatic (the creator of StorybookJS).

#### Tokens

Keep your code in sync with your design using Sass variables or CSS custom properties.

If you need to support many different platforms, consider [**Style Dictionary**](https://styledictionary.com/). It helps you use your tokens in iOS, Android, and more.

### Documentation

Effective documentation is crucial for ensuring adoption and consistency.

- [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/): All in one solution for documentation and component library.
- [**Starlight**](https://starlight.astro.build/): A lightweight, fast, accessible and easy-to-use documentation site generator using Astro.
- [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/): A popular open-source tool for building documentation sites, maintained by Facebook. Supports Markdown, JSX, and multiple languages.

## Core Strategies

### Define Your Approach to Customization

Decide how much customization is allowed and under what circumstances. Consider:

- How customization can improve usability without diluting the brand.
- How customization options can improve reusability without overcomplicating things or make it hard to maintain.
- Write clear guidelines on customization and what to avoid.
- Define recommendations for customizing components or extending the design system.
- Create a policy for supporting edge cases. Outline possible limitations and explain how requests are handled. Be consistent and clear about expectations.
- Encourage contributions to improve the flexibility of the design system but hold to your principles.

### Managing Changes and Version Control

Version control helps you track updates and avoid breaking existing implementations.

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: Use semantic versioning to manage updates and ensure compatibility. Major versions for breaking changes, minor versions for new features, and patch versions for bug fixes.
- **Changelog**: Maintain a changelog to document what has changed in each version. This is crucial for both developers and designers to understand the impact of changes.

### Quality and Testing Strategies

Test your design system often. Use rigorous testing and version control to keep it reliable and easy to maintain.

- **Web Accessibility (a11y)**: Regularly perform accessibility audits and fix issues to make sure your design system is accessible to all users.
- **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback and ensure that your design system meets the needs of end-users.
- **Quality Assurance**: Establish QA practices to keep your design system robust and reliable.
- **Peer Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews to catch issues early and make sure that the design system upholds quality standards.

## Distribution

Distribute your design system in ways that make it accessible, usable, and maintainable. Here are some common methods and tools:

### Hosting the Design System

#### Package Managers

- [**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/): Publish your design system as an NPM package to allow other developers to easily install and use your components via `npm install`.
- [**PNPM**](https://pnpm.io/): pnpm is a fast, efficient package manager that saves disk space, speeds up installs, and helps manage multiple repo's in one (monorepos).
- [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/): Another package manager that can be used to distribute your design system on NPM. It offers quick installs, support for multiple repo's (monorepos), and dependency caching.
- [**GitHub Package**](https://docs.github.com/en/packages): Host your design system as a package on GitHub, making it easy to manage and distribute through Git.

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Automate the build, test, deploy, and distribution of your design system.

- **GitHub Actions**: Use GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deploying changes.
- **CircleCI**: Use CircleCI to automate continuous integration and continuous deployment processes.

Automate the small stuff first, like linting and formatting. Avoid burnout by automating repetitive or tedious tasks and/or updating guidance.

### Managing Access

- **Public vs. Private**: Decide whether your design system will be public or for internal use only.
- **Authentication**: Use methods like OAuth or JWT to control access to the design system and documentation, especially if it's meant for internal teams.
