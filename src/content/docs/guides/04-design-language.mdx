A design language is a set of design rules (like colors, fonts, and spacing, etc.) that bring consistency and personality to your products.

It gives developers good-looking products from the start and designers the flexibility to extend and get creative. Most importantly, it's the shared language _everyone_ on your team can use to communicate.

**Why a design language is important**

- **Identity:** Build your brand's identity in from the start.
- **Consistency:** Every product or page has a consistent appearance, even when teams or tools change.
- **Collaboration:** Clear, semantically named tokens lets everyone speak the same language. For example, it's easier to say _primary color_ instead of `#ff69b4` or `pink`.
- **Scalability:** New features naturally adopt the same style, saving time and effort.
- **Quality:** Start from a solid foundation based on accessibility and usability so your design holds up over time.

Now that you know why design language matters, let’s look at the core elements that make it work. These building blocks help your team create products that are both consistent and flexible.

## Core Elements & Design Tokens

The building blocks of a design language are colors, typography, spacing, icons, and tone of voice.

### Colors

Create a color system based on your brand (blues, grays, reds, greens, etc.). From that, create grades for each color from 0 to 100.

Then create a main color palette (primary, accent, secondary, base, etc.). Use these colors to ensure accessible combinations. Then apply them to component and state colors.

If you're using USWDS as a foundation, you already have an accessible color system and can create accessible color palettes with [system color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/).

Token breakdown (using USWDS as an example):

<Steps>

1. **Primitive color:** `#0050d8`

2. **Semantic token**: `'blue-warm-60v'`

3. **Semantic theme and state tokens:**
   - **Theme token**: `primary-vivid`
   - **State:** `success`
   - **Component:** `banner-background-color`

   Choosing the right type of token can be tricky. Use theme tokens whenever possible to keep the design consistent. It also gives users the ability to make high-level changes without having to adjust multiple smaller details.

</Steps>

### Typography

Typography covers font sizes, weights, line spacing, and line width (measure). Choose clear, readable typefaces that work well together in a variety of scenarios, like:

- Headings
- Long-form content
- UI elements
- Tabular data
- Quotes, small text, and emphasis
- Code

Like colors, primitives are then reused in theme tokens. For example:

<Steps>

1. **Primitive typeface:**

   ```css
   -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol"
   ```

2. **Semantic token**: `'system'`

3. **Semantic theme tokens:**
   - **Type based:** `sans`
   - **Role based:** `ui`

</Steps>

### Spacing

Spacing includes margins, padding, and layout or grid systems. Consistent spacing makes layouts clean and familiar. Having a system for spacing is important to have a cohesive design.

USWDS is based on multiples of `8px`, but others could be more fine-grained, like systems of `3px`. For smaller sizes and fine-grained control, it's important to include half-sizes.

Here's an example of a potential hierarchy of spacing tokens:

<Steps>

1. **Primitive spacing tokens:** `4px`, `8px`, `12px`, `16px`, `32px`.

2. **Semantic tokens**: `0.5`, `1`, `1.5`, `2`, `mobile-lg`.

3. **Theme tokens:** In components, spacing is set in theme variables that map to semantic tokens, so for example:

   ```scss
   $theme-banner-max-width: "desktop";
   ```

   This lets users override in component theme settings. You can immediately tell what it's doing.

</Steps>

### States

States describe how elements look and behave when users interact. This includes interactive states like hover, active, disabled, or focus, as well as UI states like success, error, warning, and information.

### Icons

Icons are visual cues for actions, navigation, or status. Apply icons consistently and keep them consistent in style, stroke width, and size. **Use icons to support text—not replace it!**

### Tone of Voice

Tone of voice is how your design system "sounds" in writing. Your team should decide if your product is friendly, direct, neutral, formal, etc.

If you're working on non-government projects, it can help to brainstorm with your team:

> "If your product was a Hollywood actor, who would it be and why?"

Putting a familiar face to your product can help set the voice and tone. This helps teams create consistent, accessible, and user-centered products.

### Summary

A well-defined design language is the foundation of a strong design system. It gives teams the building blocks to create products that are consistent, accessible, and familiar no matter the team size.

When everyone uses the same building blocks and speaks the same language, products are easier to build, easier to maintain, and easier for users to trust.

Take the time to think about these foundational elements so your design system is easy to use and scale.
