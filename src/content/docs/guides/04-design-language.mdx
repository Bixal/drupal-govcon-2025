title: Your Design Language
description: A guide to building a consistent and flexible design language for your apps using USWDS and SASS.

A design language is a set of design rules (like colors, fonts, and spacing, etc.) that bring consistency and personality to your products.

It gives developers good looking products from the start and designers the flexibility of extending and getting creative. Most importantly, it's the shared language _everyone_ on your team can use to communicate.

**Why a design language is important**

- **Identity:** Build in your brand's identity from the start.
- **Consistency:** Every product or page has a consistent appearance, even when teams or tools change.
- **Collaboration:** Clear semantically named tokens, like _primary color_ instead of `#ff69b4`, lets everyone speak the same language.
- **Scalability:** New features naturally adopt the same style, which saves time and effort.
- **Quality:** Start from a solid foundation based on accessibility and usability so your design holds up over time.

Next, we'll see how you can apply these ideas using USWDS themes. It's especially helpful if you're supporting multiple sites.

## Flexible USWDS Themes

If you've used USWDS, you know it starts with a default theme you can customize with SASS variables. But if you manage multiple sites, you should consider creating your own base design language. This saves you from maintaining separate "base" themes or keep copying the same overrides for each project.

Keep your base theme simple and neutral, with just enough branding to set the tone. This way, your team can easily extend, experiment with new themes, or add their own branding when needed.

### The Default Theme

USWDS comes with a default theme that you've probably seen many times.

By default, the primary USWDS color is `blue-60v` (`#005ea2`), the main body font is Source Sans Pro, and the headings are Merriweather Web.

If you need to apply your agencies branding, it's simple. We update the relevant theme settings.

### Overriding the Defaults

You can update the theme settings directly in SCSS. It's the recommended way to override them. Here's an example of how your project structure might look:

<FileTree>

- package.json
- src
  - assets
    - styles
      - \_uswds-theme.scss # Your custom USWDS theme settings
      - \_your-custom-project-styles.scss # Your project's custom styles
      - index.scss # Your main styles entrypoint
  - components
    - …

</FileTree>

Below is an example of a custom USWDS theme override, based on the official USWDS docs.

This SCSS partial sets some global settings and theme overrides:

```scss
// _uswds-theme.scss

@use "uswds-core" with (
  $theme-show-compile-warnings: false,
  $theme-show-notifications: false,
  //
  // Typography
  //
  $theme-font-type-sans: "public-sans",
  //
  // Colors
  //
  // Base gray
  $theme-color-base-family: "gray",
  $theme-color-base-lightest: "gray-10",
  $theme-color-base-lighter: "gray-20",
  $theme-color-base-light: "gray-30",
  $theme-color-base: "gray-60",
  $theme-color-base-dark: "gray-70",
  $theme-color-base-darker: "gray-80",
  $theme-color-base-darkest: "gray-90",
  $theme-color-base-ink: "gray-80",

  // Primary
  $theme-color-primary-family: "indigo-cool-vivid",
  $theme-color-primary-lightest: "indigo-cool-5",
  $theme-color-primary-lighter: "indigo-cool-10",
  $theme-color-primary-light: "indigo-cool-30",
  $theme-color-primary: "indigo-cool-60v",
  $theme-color-primary-vivid: "indigo-60v",
  $theme-color-primary-dark: "indigo-cool-70v",
  $theme-color-primary-darker: "indigo-cool-80v",
  $theme-color-primary-darkest: "indigo-cool-90v"
);
```

  Colors are from [System color tokens |
  USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/#indigo).

Then you'd import it into your main SASS entrypoint.

```diff
// index.scss

+@forward "uswds-theme;
@forward "uswds";
@forward "your-custom-project-styles";
```

And your landing page should now use the Public Sans typeface and have a light gray and indigo based color scheme.

A single custom theme works for one site. Now fast forward a few months and now you have to extend that original custom theme for several related products. Reusing that theme can get messy fast. You'd have to:

1. Create a new file
1. Copy over settings
1. Override what you previously overwrote
1. Keep any settings in sync from one to the other

If you wanted to create more themes maintaining them would be a hassle.

Luckily, SASS's new module system lets you easily override and use that as a base, which you can then override again for each new site. This makes updates easier.

<Steps>

1.  #### Create a Base Theme

    In `_uswds-theme.scss` update your `@use` to `@forward`. For clarity, name your base theme after your main product. For example, Digital Gov would be `_dg-base-uswds-theme.scss`.

    ```diff
    // _uswds-theme-base.scss

    - @use "uswds-core" with (
    + @forward "uswds-core" with (
      // …
    );
    ```

    Use `@forward` to share settings. The `@use` brings those settings to the current file, so you can use them right away.

    ```diff
    // index.scss

    -@forward "uswds-theme;
    +@forward "uswds-theme-extended;
    @forward "uswds";
    @forward "your-custom-project-styles";
    ```

2.  #### Make an Extended Theme

    Next, make a new SASS partial called `_uswds-theme-extended.scss`. For clarity, you can rename it to match your product. For example, if your site is PlainLanguage.gov, name the file: `_dg-pl-uswds-theme.scss`.

    {/* prettier-ignore-start */}

        <FileTree>
          - package.json
          - src
            - assets
            - styles
              - \_uswds-theme.scss
              - **\_uswds-theme-extended.scss** # New extended theme from base.
              - index.scss
            - components
            - …

        </FileTree>

    {/* prettier-ignore-end */}

3.  #### Reusing and Extending Base Theme

    Open the new file and use your new base theme settings file.

    ```scss
    // _uswds-theme-extended.scss
    @use "uswds-theme-base";
    ```

    This approach makes it easy to reuse your base theme. If you’re building a related site (like an intranet, brochure, or documentation site) you get the same consistent look with less effort.

4.  #### Customizing the Child Theme

    To create a new theme, just update the settings that are different from your base. You only need to change what’s different for each product.

    For example, if you’re building a site based on the DigitalGov theme, just update the colors or branding that are specific to that product:

    ```scss
    // _uswds-theme-extended.scss
    @use "uswds-theme-base" with (
      $theme-color-primary-family: "violet",
      $theme-color-primary-lightest: "violet-5",
      $theme-color-primary-lighter: "violet-10",
      $theme-color-primary-light: "violet-30",
      $theme-color-primary: "violet-60",
      $theme-color-primary-vivid: "violet-60v",
      $theme-color-primary-dark: "violet-70",
      $theme-color-primary-darker: "violet-80",
      $theme-color-primary-darkest: "violet-90"
    );
    ```

    This approach layers your changes on top of your base theme, so you can quickly manage multiple themes that share a look but each have their own details.
