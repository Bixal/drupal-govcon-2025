A design language is how you combine your basic elements (fonts, colors, spacing, etc.) to create a unified design experience with some light branding. It's a good first step to add a little personality to your products.

It allows developers to have good looking products from the start and designers the flexibility of extending and getting really creative. Most importantly, whatever direction you go in your product will be **consistent**, which is essential for earning trust.

**Why a design language is important**

- **A unique identity.** Apply your brand identity as a base theme so others can have a good default, but the flexibility of getting creative.
- **A consistent experience.** Your base theme will be immediately useful to developers who might not have designers immediately available. For example, a dashboard or a documentation site for a product.
- **Easier collaboration.** Teams can speak the same language by using semantically named tokens, like primary color or primary pink instead of `#ff69b4`.
- **Scalability.** New features naturally adopt the language, so you don't need to spend too much time or effort in tailoring it to your brand identity.
- **Quality checks.** Starting from a solid foundation based on accessibility and usability ensures that components are consistent and cohesive over time.

## USWDS as a Foundation

If you've used USWDS before you'll know that it has a default theme that you can override with SASS variables, but if you're in charge of several sites you should consider creating your own base design language to avoid having to maintain separate "base" themes.

Your base theme should be as "boring" as you can make it with some branding. That way other products can extend, explore theming options, and apply their own branding.
