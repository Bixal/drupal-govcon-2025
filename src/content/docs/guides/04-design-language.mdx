A design language is a set of design rules (like colors, fonts, and spacing, etc.) that bring consistency and personality to your products.

It gives developers good looking products from the start and designers the flexibility of extending and getting creative. Most importantly, it's the shared language _everyone_ on your team can use to communicate.

**Why a design language is important**

- **Identity:** Build in your brand's identity from the start.
- **Consistency:** Every product or page has a consistent appearance, even when teams or tools change.
- **Collaboration:** Clear semantically named tokens, like _primary color_ instead of `#ff69b4`, lets everyone speak the same language.
- **Scalability:** New features naturally adopt the same style, which saves time and effort.
- **Quality:** Start from a solid foundation based on accessibility and usability so your design holds up over time.

Next, we'll see how you can apply these ideas using USWDS themes. It's especially helpful if you're supporting multiple sites.

## Core Elements & Design Tokens

The building blocks to design language are colors, typography, spacing, icons, and tone of voice.

### Colors

Create a color system based on your brand (blues, grays, reds, greens, etc). From that, create grades for each color from 0 to 100.

Then create a primary color palette (primary, accent, secondary, base). Then use those to define component and state colors, but also to ensure accessible combinations.

If you're using USWDS as a foundation, you already have an accessible color system you can create accessible color palettes with [system color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/).

Token breakdown (using USWDS as an example):

<Steps>

1. **Primitive color:** `#0050d8`

2. **Semantic token**: `'blue-warm-60v'`

3. **Semantic theme and state tokens:**
   1. Theme: `primary-vivid`
   2. State: `success`
   3. Component: `banner-background-color`

   It's a delicate balance to know which one to use and when. You should rely on theme tokens as much as you can so that users can easily change at a high level without having to go in and override multiple smaller settings.

</Steps>

### Typography

Typography covers font sizes, weights, line spacing, and line width (measure). Choose a clear, readable typefaces that work well together in a variety of scenarios like:

- Headings
- Long form content
- UI elements
- Tabular data
- Quotes, small text, and emphasis
- Code

Like colors, primitives are then reused in theme tokens, for example:

<Steps>

1. **Primitive typeface:**

   ```css
   -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol"
   ```

2. **Semantic token**: `'system'`

3. **Semantic theme tokens:**
   - Type based: `sans`
   - Role based : `ui`

</Steps>

### Spacing

Spacing includes margins, padding, and layout/grid systems. Consistent spacing makes layouts clean and familiar. Having a system here is important.

USWDS is based on multiples of `8px`, but other could be more fine-grained, like systems of `3px`. In smaller sizes it's important to include half-sizes.

Here's an example of the potential hierarchy of spacing tokens:

<Steps>

1. **Primitive spacing tokens:** `4px`, `8px`, `12px`, `16px`, `32px`.

2. **Semantic tokens**: `1`, `mobile-lg`.

3. **Semantic theme tokens:** In components, spacing is set in theme variables:

   ```scss
   $theme-banner-max-width: "desktop";
   ```

   Which users can override in component theme settings.

</Steps>

### States

How elements look and behave when users interact. This can mean interactive states, like: hover, active, disabled, or focus. But also UI states, like success, error, warning, and information.

### Icons

Visual cues for actions, navigating, or status. Keep icons consistent with the same style, stroke width, and size. Use icons to support text, **not** replace it and make sure you're providing context if it's meaningful.

### Tone of Voice

Tone of voice is how your design system "sounds" in writing. Your team has to decide if your product is friendly, direct, neutral, formal, etc.

If you're working on non-government projects, it's helpful to think with the team:

> "If your product was a Hollywood actor, who would it be and why?"

Putting a familiar face could help set the voice and tone for your product. It helps teams create consistent, accessible, and user-centered products.

### Summary

Having a well-defined set of core elements makes your design language easy to use and scale.
