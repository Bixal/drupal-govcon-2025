Understanding the lifecycle of a UI component is crucial for creating a maintainable design system. This comprehensive guide covers the phases and considerations from idea to implementation. By following this guide, you will be able to create well-structured UI components that align with user needs, ensuring the long-term success and usability of your design system.

6. [Maintain](#6-maintain)

### 1. Discovery

#### Accessibility Analysis

Perform an accessibility analysis to identify potential accessibility obstacles that might surface during user testing. This step is crucial for ensuring that your components will be usable by all users, including those with different abilties.

- Assess WCAG standards and determine which guidelines will need to be consulted.
- Ensure that user testing includes participants with disabilities to gather insights on how the component performs for users with different needs.
- Record and document the findings from your accessibility analysis to guide future design decisions and improvements.

#### Research and Why It's Important

Research is a critical step in ensuring that your components meet the user's needs and are aligned with business goals.

- **Landscape Analysis**: Evaluate existing solutions and identify gaps. Analyze competitive products and standards to inform your design decisions.
- **Accessibility Analysis:** Perform an accessibility analysis to identify potential accessibility obstacles and relevant WCAG criteria that might surface during user testing. This step is crucial for ensuring that your components will be usable by all users, including those with different abilties.
- **User Testing**: Conduct usability tests to understand user needs and behaviors including participants with disabilities. This helps in designing components that are intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Customer Feedback**: Gather feedback from stakeholders and end-users to validate your design decisions and make necessary adjustments.
- **Document Findings**: Record and document the findings from your research to guide future design decisions and improvements.

#### Prototyping: Where and How

Prototyping is essential for visualizing and testing your ideas before full-scale development.

- **Tools**: Use tools like Figma or Storybook to create interactive prototypes.
- **Testing**: Share prototypes with stakeholders and users for feedback. Evaluate and prioritize feedback to iterate based on feedback received.

#### Planning for Rollout

Understanding how the new component will be introduced into the design system is crucial for ensuring a smooth and effective rollout. This can be done through a coordinated release or iteratively under a feature flag.

- **Communicate the addition**: Ensure clear communication with all stakeholders, including designers, developers, and product managers, as well as planned communication to end users.
- **Coordinate Release**: Schedule a coordinated release where all teams are aligned and prepared for the new component. This approach is useful when the component requires significant changes across multiple products or resources.
- **Feature flag release vs full release**: Determine if you want to launch the component to the all users at the same time or use a feature flag to roll out the component gradually. This approach allows you to gather feedback and make adjustments as needed before full release.
- **Feedback Loop**: Ensure a mechanism for feedback to collect user and stakeholder feedback on the new component.

### 3. Development

#### Development

- **API & Customization**: Define the component API and ensure it is flexible and customizable. Consider how users can extend or modify the component to fit their specific needs. Ensure the API is clear and consistent. Provide hooks or props to allow for customization.
- **Testing**: Implement robust testing strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of your components.
  - **Unit Testing**: Verify the functionality of individual components using tools like Jest or React Testing Library.
  - **Integration Testing**: Ensure components work together seamlessly using tools like Cypress.
  - **Accessibility Testing**: Use tools like Axe to ensure your components are accessible to all users.
- **Guidance**: Provide clear documentation and guidelines for using the component, including examples and best practices.

#### Integration and Maintenance

- **Document**: Maintain comprehensive documentation to support developers and designers.
  - **Testing Checklist**: Document the testing procedures and checklist.
  - **Development Stages Outline**: Provide a clear outline of the development stages.
  - **Release Checklist**: Document the steps and criteria for releasing a component.

- **Organize Components**: Organize components in a way that promotes reusability and discoverability within the component library.

#### Anatomy of a USWDS Component

A well-designed component should be consistent, reusable, and maintainable.

- **Well-Built Component**: A good component should have a clear structure, well-defined props, and thorough documentation.
  - **Structure**: Components should be modular and easily integrated with other parts of the design system.
  - **Props**: Define a clear API with well-documented props and modifiers.
  - **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation, including usage examples, props tables, and design guidelines.

## Considerations & Requirements to Creating Your Own Component

### Key Considerations

- **User-Centric Design**: Always design with the user in mind. Ensure your components meet the needs of the end-user.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in design and behavior across all components to ensure a cohesive user experience.
- **Stick to simplicity**: Avoid overly complicated components that try to account for too many variants and customizations.
- **Performance**: Optimize components for performance to ensure they load quickly and are responsive.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure your components are accessible to users with disabilities. Follow WCAG guidelines and use accessibility testing tools.

### Requirements

- **Research**: Conduct thorough research to validate design decisions.
- **Prototyping**: Create prototypes for user testing and feedback.
- **Development**: Implement robust development practices, including testing, documentation, and customization.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update and maintain components to address new requirements and improve performance.
