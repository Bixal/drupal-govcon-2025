Have you heard of the lottery or bus factor? It's a way to measure the risk of not having knowledge or a specific skill in your team. A low factor means high risk and a high factor means low risk, so the higher the better.

Let's say you've been working on your product for a year and you're pretty comfortable with the way things work and know the ins and outs of how things work. If you win the lottery tomorrow and decide to retire; does the team have enough knowledge to seamlessly continue working while you sip mojito's on the beach?

If you don't play the lottery or have any luck, imagine you want to take some much needed time off. Things need to continue while you recharge and relax.

By the end of this section you'll have a pretty good idea of how to set up basic processes that will help you manage your design system, things to look out for, and practical advice on how to get started to set your team up for success. Not just for the eventual fortune you'll acquire, but to grow your design system, make it easier to make changes, and increase the overall knowledge of your team.
