Have you heard of the lottery or bus factor? It measures the risk your team faces if only a few people have key knowledge or skills. If someone leaves, important knowledge could be lost forever. A high factor means low risk, because there's more shared knowledge across the team.

Imagine you've been working on a product for a year. You're pretty comfortable with the project and all of its ins and outs. If you win the lottery tomorrow and decide to retire, can the team continue working without skipping a beat?

Even if you don't play the lottery or plan to leave, imagine you want to take some much needed time off. Work needs to continue without interruption while you recharge and relax.

By the end of this section, you'll know how to set up clear processes to help manage your design system. You'll learn what to watch out for and get practical advice to help your team succeed. Not just for the eventual fortune you'll win, but also to help your design system grow, make updates easier, and increase your team's overall knowledge.

## The Importance of Documentation

Documentation is more than just code comments. It's how you share knowledge, explain how you work, what things to look out for, show how to deliver a high-quality work, and how decisions are made and why. Good documentation helps new team members get started easily. Documenting shows you're doing things intentionally and helps you remember past decisions and lessons learned.

These are some types of docs you should consider for your project:

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).** Record major architectural decisions. It helps the team make decisions and understand why things were done a certain way.
- **Team Charter.** How we work, our preferences, and team dynamics.
- **Process docs.** How releases are done, how to deploy, guides for writing, how to conduct research and what types of research, sprint ceremonies, etc.
- **Vulnerabilities and security.** A security process for remediating vulnerabilities. Where and how people can submit reports.
- **Customer support.** Supporting users and troubleshooting guides. For example, help desk templates, response templates, pager duty, guidance for supporting users and metrics to capture.
- **Component guidance and API documentation.** How your component works, when to use, when not to use, usability and accessibility considerations, and available settings.
- **Changelogs.** Records of what changed and when. These are helpful in components and documentation pages so users can clearly see when and what changes were made.
- **Release notes.** Templates for release notes, both individual features and the full notes when you release. For full notes, outline features, bug fixes, dependency and security changes. Whether changes are breaking or not, along with notes on the PR that fixed them, a summary of the changes, and how they affect teams.
- **Roadmap and planning.** Templates for brainstorming sessions on roadmap items. This can be done in Miro, FigJam, or plain docs. The important thing is to have a clear long-term vision alongside features you want to see and those users are requesting. Your main priority should be long-term strategic goals, but you should also try to include highly requested features. This builds trust, addresses real user needs, and fosters a community around your product.
- **Licensing and legal.** Clearly outline what types of licensing your product falls under, but also what's allowed in your project. The last thing you want is to be tied up in legal issues because you misused an asset or forgot to attribute correctly.
- **How to contribute.** Guidance on how users can contribute back, code style, expected tests and guidance, what help you're looking for or prioritizing.

Yes, it's a lot, but you don't need to do it all at once. Start with what you know and most importantly treat your documentation as living documents. Keep them close to where the work happens and regularly go back and make sure it's still accurate and useful.

For onboarding, have new members strictly follow the README or main guide. If they find something that's unclear or could be improved, have them update the documentation as part of their onboarding. This helps validate your docs, onboard new team members, and lets them contribute immediately.

For recurring processes, like sprint retros; add some frontmatter at the top. Review and update the doc before/after each retro to keep it useful.

How frontmatter helps explain how to use. This way anyone can run the sprint retro.

```md

A template for bi-weekly sprint retros.

Best practices:

- Add a new date entry for each retro.
- Focus on what was achieved, not just what happened. Be open and transparent without blame or judgement.
- Use a 2 to 5 minute timer for each column to keep meeting on track and respect everyone's time.
- If you agree with something, add a "➕" at the end.
- End each retro with clear action items. Make sure the team agrees, has an assignee, and a target date.

## Governance: What it is & Why it Matters

Governance means setting clear rules and systems for managing and updating your design system. This includes:

- Who makes the decisions
- How changes get made
- Setting guidelines everyone can follow
- Keeping things organized and useful

It's a critical part of growing the design system and keeping it useful.

Even if you don't think you need them now, these things will help your team and your users in the future:

- ADRs
- Contribution guidelines
- The types of issues you prioritize
- An accessibility baseline
- The browsers you support
- Run regular audits on a cadence that works for your team to ensure quality and accessibility. Document how it's done, how often, and potential issues or next steps.
- Establish Communication channels. Let people know where they can go for help, discuss features, make requests, report issues, and more.
- Maintain changelogs. Show what types of changes were made, when, and how.
- Create a process for deprecating components or adding new experimental ones.
- Creating a working group to understand team challenges or what to prioritize

You don't have to implement all of these at once, but eventually you'll be asked about them.

## Customer Support & Maintenance

Okay, you're a small team knocking components and guidance out; teams are starting to adopt your work—that's great! As you get more eyes on your work you'll start getting questions, a team will find an issue, or will ask about a roadmap item.

It's important to be ready for requests or issues, respond as quickly as you can (even if it's just acknowledging the requests), and have a process for handling these things. Listening to customers is fundamental to building trust.

You can't address everything immediately, so consider these key points:

1. **Set clear expectations.** Outside of emergencies, no one is expecting immediate turnaround. Be clear about what you prioritize, average response times, and how people can report different types of issues. Provide basic guidance for handling critical issues. For example, have a special email or communication channel for security issues. Direct people to GitHub for non-urgent issues.
1. **Be proactive and prompt.** You don't have to give a solution immediately, but it's important to acknowledge requests as soon as you can and set reasonable goals for responding.
1. **Encourage teams to get in touch.** Provide multiple ways for people to reach out, like an email, a place to discuss code changes (like an open repo), where to share UX research, and where to ask general questions. Create a process to triage requests.

Maintain open communication channels, let people know your priorities, set a process for regular triage, and (most importantly) use your principles to prioritize!

## Getting Buy-in & Metrics

A design system is a lot of work. Sometimes it can feel like you're constantly justifying its need, which can be exhausting, but it doesn't have to be that way if you track data and metrics from the start. This way you can make metrics a part of your process and have the data to show the value of the design system. Again, your principles can help guide what's important to track.

Here are some metrics you should consider capturing in a spreadsheet or internal doc everyone has access to:

- **Design System Use.** Setup a regular cadence for checking NPM downloads, the number of components being used, which sites are using the design system, and the number of page visits.
- **Customer support.** Have a method of regularly getting feedback, like a feedback form on your site or a brief questionnaire after a customer support ticket. This way you can track how many tickets come through, average response time, and satisfaction scores.
- **Accessibility compliance**. How compliant your components are and the number of accessibility issues. Sharing this publicly builds trust in your product!
- **Contribution and Activity.** How active the code repo and slack channel are, how many PR's are being opened, and how long features take to ship.
- **Code and features.** Log the time it takes to create a component to show how much time is saved by downstream teams. Track metrics over time, like performance or security. For example, measure the size of the codebase before and after changes and track lighthouse scores. Log vulnerabilities and their severity so you can track and confidently speak to your system's security over time.

Most importantly, share wins and progress through channels like Slack, presentations, your website, or newsletters.

Be transparent and honest about the work, what was done, why it was done, and share wins and lessons learned. This helps teams see challenges, reaffirms your long-term vision, and increases everyone's knowledge.

These ideas aren't exclusive to design systems. Apply them to your projects to show your teams effectiveness and the work being done.

## Wrap-up

Hopefully you got a better understanding of the importance of documentation and governance. Good documentation and governance can help you produce high-quality work consistently, onboard new team members faster, and respond quickly and confidently to changes.

Be iterative in your approach and always look to improve. This way, you'll be set up for long-term success, provide real value with your design system, and be ready for your eventual lottery win.
