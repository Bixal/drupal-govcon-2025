A template for bi-weekly sprint retros.

Best practices:

- Add a new date entry for each retro.
- Focus on what was achieved, not just what happened. Be open and transparent without blame or judgement.
- Use a 2 to 5 minute timer for each column to keep meeting on track and respect everyone's time.
- If you agree with something, add a "âž•" at the end.
- End each retro with clear action items. Make sure the team agrees, has an assignee, and a target date.
